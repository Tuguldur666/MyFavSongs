We lose ourselves, but we find it all<br>

    [Kurt Cobain] Fuck you all, this is the last song of the evening<br>
    [Dave Grohl] What is it?<br>
    [Kurt Cobain] This was written by (what?) my favorite performer. Our <br>favorite perfomer, isn't it? All of ours? You like him the best?
    [Krist Novoselic] Oh and here's a donation basket for one supply of <br>Leadbelly's guitar<br>
    [Kurt Cobain] Oh yeah, this guy representing the Leadbelly's estate wants <br>to sell me Leadbelly's guitar for $500,000<br>
    [Krist Novoselic] Passing a basket<br>
    [Kurt Cobain] Yeah, I even asked David Geffen personally if he'd buy it for <br>me. He wouldn't do it<br>

    [Verse 1]<br>
    My girl, my girl, don't lie to me<br>
    Tell me where did you sleep last night<br>
    In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine<br>
    I would shiver the whole night through<br>

    My girl, my girl, where will you go?<br>
    I'm going where the cold wind blows<br>
    In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine<br>

    Her husband was a hard working man<br>
    Just about a mile from here<br>
    His head was found in a driving wheel<br>
    But his body never was found<br>

Never cared for what they know<br>
And I know, yeah-yeah!<br>
[Guitar Solo]<br>

[Verse 1]<br>
So close, no matter how far<br>
Couldn't be much more from the heart<br>
Forever trusting who we are<br>

[Refrain]<br>
No, nothing else matters<br>

        [Instrumental Intro] <br>

[Verse 1] <br>
Say your prayers, little one, don't forget, my son <br>
To include everyone <br>
I tuck you in, warm within, keep you free from sin <br>
'Til the Sandman, he comes <br>

[Pre-Chorus] <br>
Sleep with one eye open <br>
Gripping your pillow tight <br>

Exit light <br>
Enter night <br>
Take my hand <br>

[Verse 2] <br>
Something's wrong, shut the light, heavy thoughts tonight <br>
And they aren't of Snow White <br>
Dreams of war, dreams of liars, dreams of dragons' fire <br>
And of things that will bite, yeah <br>

Sleep with one eye open <br>
Gripping your pillow tight <br>

Yeah-hah <br>

[Guitar Solo] <br>

[Bridge] <br>
Now, I lay me down to sleep (Now, I lay me down to sleep) <br>
Pray the Lord my soul to keep (Pray the Lord my soul to keep) <br>
If I die before I wake (If I die before I wake) <br>
Pray the Lord my soul to take (Pray the Lord my soul to take) <br>
Hush, little baby, don't say a word <br>
And never mind that noise you heard <br> 
It's just the beasts under your bed <br>
In your closet, in your head <br>

Exit light <br>

    [Verse 1] <br>
New blood joins this Earth, and quickly he's subdued<br>
Through constant pained disgrace, the young boy learns their rules<br>
With time the child draws in, this whipping boy done wrong<br>
Deprived of all his thoughts, the young man struggles on and on, he's known<br>
Ooh, a vow unto his own that never from this day<br>
His will they'll take away, yeah<br>

[Chorus]<br>
What I've felt, what I've known<br>
Never shined through in what I've shown<br>
Never be, never see<br>
Won't see what might have been<br>
What I've felt, what I've known<br>
Never shined through in what I've shown<br>
Never free, never me<br>
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
They dedicate their lives to running all of his<br>
He tries to please them all, this bitter man he is<br>
Throughout his life the same, he's battled constantly<br>
This fight he cannot win, a tired man they see no longer cares<br>
The old man then prepares to die regretfully<br>
That old man here is me, yeah<br>

[Chorus]<br>
What I've felt, what I've known<br>
Never shined through in what I've shown<br>
Never be, never see<br>
Won't see what might have been<br>
What I've felt, what I've known<br>
Never shined through in what I've shown<br>
Never free, never me<br>

Never shined through in what I've shown<br>

[Outro]<br>
Never free, never me<br>
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"<br>
You labeled me, I'll label you<br>
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"<br>
Ah, never free, never me<br>
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"<br>
You labeled me, I'll label you<br>

        [Verse 1] <br>
        I've got another confession to make<br>
        So complicated let me try to explain<br>
        Don't want this feeling to go away<br>
        So it stay, it stays, it stays, it stays<br>
        <br>
        [Pre-Chorus]<br>
        Is it the way that you talk<br>
        That's causing me to freak?<br>
        Is it the way that you laugh<br>
        That's making my heart beat?<br>
        Is it the way that you kiss?<br>
        It's gotta be the way that taste (you taste x3)<br>
        [Chorus]<br>
        You're such a gorgeous nightmare<br>
        Old habits never seem to go away<br>
        You make me feel brand new, yeah<br>
        We resurrect, it's like I've come back to life<br>

        [Post-Chorus]<br>
        I feel so alive, I feel so alive!<br>
        <br>
        [Verse 2]<br>
        First impressions are hard to erase<br>
        Etched in my mind and it just won't go away<br>
        Maybe I'm playing my cards way too safe<br>
        I've gotta change, change, change, change<br>
        <br>
        [Pre-Chorus]<br>
        Is it the way that you feel against my body?<br>
        Is it the way that you act so damn naughty?<br>
        Is it the way that you shake<br>
        When your hips move to the bass, the bass, the bass, the bass<br>
        <br>
        [Chorus]<br>
        You're such a gorgeous nightmare<br>

    <p>
        [Verse 1] <br>
Now I will tell you what I've done for you <br>
Fifty thousand tears I've cried <br>
Screaming, deceiving and bleeding for you <br>
And you still won't hear me (Going under) <br>
Don't want your hand this time, I'll save myself <br>
Maybe I'll wake up for once (Wake up for once) <br>
Not tormented, daily defeated by you <br>
Just when I thought I'd reached the bottom <br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus] <br>
I'm dying again <br>
[Chorus] <br>
I'm going under (Going under) <br>
Drowning in you (Drowning in you) <br>
I'm falling forever (Falling forever) <br>
I've got to break through <br>
I'm going under <br>

[Verse 2] <br>
Blurring and stirring the truth and the lies <br>
(So I don't know what's real) <br>
So I don't know what's real and what's not <br>
(Don't know what's real and what's not) <br>
Always confusing the thoughts in my head (Oh) <br>
So I can't trust myself anymore <br>

[Pre-Chorus] <br>
I'm dying again <br>

[Chorus] <br>
I'm going under (Going under) <br>
Drowning in you (Drowning in you) <br>
I'm falling forever (Falling forever) <br>
I've got to break through, I'm <br>

[Bridge] <br>
So go on and scream <br>
Scream at me, I'm so far away (So far away) <br>
I won't be broken again (Again) <br>
I've got to breathe, I can't keep going under <br>

        Forfeit the game before somebody else<br>
        Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame<br>
        Cover up your face, you can't run the race<br>

        [Intro: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda] <br>
        From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)<br>
        At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)<br>
        Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)<br>
        The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)<br>
        From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)<br>
        At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)<br>
        Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)<br>
        The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)<br>
        
        [Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]<br>
        There's a place so dark, you can't see the end<br>
        (Skies cock back) And shock that which can't defend<br>
        The rain then sends dripping acidic questions<br>
        Forcefully, the power of suggestion<br>
        Then with the eyes shut, lookin' through the rust and rot, and dust<br>
        A small spot of light floods the floor<br>
        And pours over the rusted world of pretend<br>
        And the eyes ease open, and it's dark again<br>
        [Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]<br>
        From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)<br>
        At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)<br>
        Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)<br>
        The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)<br>
        
        [Chorus: Chester Bennington]<br>
        In the memory, you'll find me<br>
        Eyes burning up<br>
        The darkness holding me tightly<br>
        Until the sun rises up<br>
        <br>
        [Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]<br>
        Movin' all around, screamin' of the ups and downs<br>
        Pollution manifested in perpetual sound<br>
        The wheels go round and the sunset creeps<br>
        Behind street lamps, chain-link, and concrete<br>
        A little piece of paper with a picture drawn<br>
        Floats on down the street 'til the wind is gone<br>
        And the memory now is like the picture was then<br>
        When the paper's crumpled up, it can't be perfect again<br>
        
        [Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]<br>
        From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)<br>
        At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)<br>

        The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)<br>
        From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)<br>

        [Verse 1: Mike Shinoda] <br>
        Why does it feel like night today?<br>
        Something in here's not right today<br>
        Why am I so uptight today?<br>
        Paranoia's all I got left<br>
        I don't know what stressed me first<br>
        Or how the pressure was fed<br>
        But I know just what it feels like<br>
        To have a voice in the back of my head<br>
        
        [Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]<br>
        Like a face that I hold inside<br>
        A face that awakes when I close my eyes<br>
        A face that watches every time I lie<br>
        A face that laughs every time I fall<br>
        (And watches everything)<br>
        So I know that when it's time to sink or swim<br>
        That the face inside is here in me<br>
        Right underneath my skin<br>
        [Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]<br>
        It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back<br>
        It's like a whirlwind inside of my head<br>
        It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within<br>
        It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin<br>
        
        [Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]<br>
        I know I've got a face in me<br>
        Points out all my mistakes to me<br>
        You've got a face on the inside, too<br>
        And your paranoia's probably worse<br>
        I don't know what set me off first<br>
        But I know what I can't stand<br>
        Everybody acts like the fact of the matter<br>
        Is I can't add up to what you can<br>
        
        [Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]<br>
        But everybody has a face that they hold inside<br>
        A face that awakes when I close my eyes<br>
        A face that watches every time they lie<br>
        A face that laughs every time they fall<br>
        (And watches everything)<br>
        So you know that when it's time to sink or swim<br>
        That the face inside is watching you, too<br>
        Right inside your skin<br>
        [Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]<br>
        It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back<br>
        It's like a whirlwind inside of my head<br>
        It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within<br>
        It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin<br>
        It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back<br>
        It's like a whirlwind inside of my head<br>
        It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within<br>
        It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin<br>
        
        [Refrain: Mike Shinoda]<br>
        The face inside is right beneath your skin<br>
        The face inside is right beneath your skin<br>
        The face inside is right beneath your skin<br>
        
        [Bridge: Chester Bennington]<br>
        The sun goes down<br>
        I feel the light betray me<br>
        The sun goes down<br>
        I feel the light betray me<br>
        
        [Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]<br>

        It's like a whirlwind inside of my head<br>
        It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within<br>
        It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin (I feel the light betray me)<br>
        (The sun) It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back<br>

        [Verse 1] <br>
I've been in a rut, ducked off from the sun<br>
Bit my gun with my black gold gums<br>
I'm no fun, I'm no fun<br>
Blood run marathons down my chest (Down my chest!)<br>
I'm a mess, ain't nobody gonna clean up<br>
Bulletproof your limousine<br>
I been in the market for a brand new soul<br>
Daddy hit a brand new low<br>
Better yet, another agoraphobic episode<br>
Here we go again, here we go again, here we go<br>
Cut me up to little pieces like you're Ed Poe<br>
Let me rest in pieces underneath the floorboards<br>
Planet on fire, no fucks given<br>
I'ma let us all die, let us all die, really, I<br>
[Refrain]<br>
I haven't been good to myself<br>
And you haven't been good to me<br>
I haven't been good to myself<br>
And lately, you haven't been good to me<br>

[Verse 2]<br>
Lately, I decided I'ma stay alive<br>
I just wanna live and see society die<br>
Looking around and all I see is at the end of the line<br>
I see a dystopia, dystopia!<br>
Evil all over and no one is (Safe)<br>
Nihilist, I am the finest, though I don't align with it<br>
(We're all to blame)<br>
Keep on denying it!<br>
You think that I need you<br>
I'll show you I'm fine<br>

[Segue]<br>
You think that I need you?<br>
You think that I need you?<br>
You think that I need you?<br>
You think that I need you!?<br>

[Hook]<br>
You think that I need you (Need you!)<br>
I'll show you I'm fine (I'm fine!)<br>
You might also like<br>
[Interlude] <br>
What happens when you cut out the circuitry?<br>
The chips, machines—what's left?<br>
Flesh. We're vulnerable, fragile, weak<br>

        Think I need a plan now, uh (Ah)<br>
        Must've been nothing but a jit<br>
        Buck teeth, cut like a bowl so that you know<br>
        Started from the bottom, fighting all the way up up<br>
        I never wanna go back down<br>
        Update, I felt great for a minute straight<br>
        Call my shrink and tell him I made a mistake<br>
        If only I could delete all the pain<br>
        And upload all the things I wanted to be<br>
        Bled from my lip, bit down on it<br>
        Feel the pain and a taste so metallic<br>
        Soulless, I learned to live without it<br>
        But I'ma make it out of this so count on it<br>
        [Bridge]<br>
        It all started when I<br>
        It all started when I<br>
        It all started when I<br>
        It all started when I<br>
        
        [Verse 2]<br>
        Cut the black blood from your tongue like Lavinia<br>
        No more lies, no, not a one, I wasn't your favorite son<br>
        If only I could forget, if only I could delete<br>
        If only, if only I could delete my memory<br>
        I still would not upload everything you wanted me to be<br>
        No, truly, I'm happy you're deceased<br>
        I don't want nothing<br>
        I want everything, I want everything, I want everything<br>
        
        [Segue]<br>
        You left me for dead, all that died was my innocence<br>
        
        [Outro]<br>
        Uh, it all started when you<br>
        Left me for dead, now I've been a wreck<br>
        Mama told me daddy won't be coming back<br>
        Bled from my lip, bit down on it<br>
        Felt the pain and a taste so metallic<br>

        [Intro] <br>
        (When you die, ain't nobody gonna remember you)<br>
        (When you die, ain't nobody gonna remember you)<br>
        (When you die, ain't nobody gonna remember you)<br>
        (When you die, ain't nobody gonna remember you)<br>
        (When you die, ain't nobody gonna remember you)<br>
        Yeah<br>
        (When you die, ain't nobody gonna remember you)<br>
        (When you die, ain't nobody gonna remember you)<br>
        
        [Verse 1]<br>
        When you die, ain't nobody gonna remember you<br>
        If you don't know me by now, I don't want you to<br>
        None of your favorite rappers ever tell the truth<br>
        Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, out of my mind<br>
        It's about damn time y'all startin' to die<br>
        Lay low, I'm the ghost at your window<br>
        Went away, now I'm way away, there he go<br>
        Fuck an icon, eyes on A.I., oh, I<br>
        Fucked around and put a pipe bomb in your radio<br>
        [Pre-Chorus]<br>
        A.I., A.I., A.I., A.I.<br>
        A.I., A.I., A.I. (A.I.)<br>
        
        [Chorus]<br>
        A.I., A.I., A.I., A.I.<br>
        A.I., A.I., A.I., A.I.<br>
        (Ooh) A.I., (Ooh) A.I., (Ooh) A.I., (Ooh) A.I.<br>
        (Ooh) A.I., (Ooh) A.I., (Ooh) A.I., (Ooh) A.I.<br>
        
        [Verse 2]<br>
        I don't wanna be the one to bear the bad news<br>
        But a man who's claiming he's the man ain't a man at all<br>
        Overcompensating for the lack of ability<br>
        To really be an icon, not even a bygone<br>
        Modern-day unsustainable, painfully mundane<br>
        Forgettable, gets old in a minute<br>
        Get sold to a label then never<br>
        (See them again)<br>
        
        [Bridge]<br>
        I spend all my time listening to guys who committed suicide<br>
        It's about time, it's about time<br>
        And I only ever really cry<br>
        To wash away the blood<br>
        To wash away the blood<br>
        I only ever cry<br>
        To wash away the blood<br>
        To wash away the blood<br>
        To wash away the blood<br>
        And I only ever cry<br>
        To wash away the blood<br>
        To wash away the blood<br>
        To wash away the blood<br>
        To wash away<br>

        [Verse 3]<br>
        Don't give a damn 'bout a critic, they don't really get it<br>
        They don't make a difference, they don't buy the tickets, ah<br>
        Only really give a damn 'bout the kids<br>
        Live and die for the kids, live and die for the kids, ah<br>
        
        [Chorus]<br>
        A.I., A.I., A.I., A.I.<br>
        A.I., A.I., A.I., A.I.<br>
        (Ooh) A.I., (Ooh) A.I., (Ooh) A.I., (Ooh) A.I.<br>
        (Ooh) A.I., (Ooh) A.I., (Ooh) A.I., (Ooh) A.I.<br>
        A.I., A.I., A.I., A.I.<br>
        A.I., A.I., A.I., A.I.<br>
        (Ooh) A.I., (Ooh) A.I., (Ooh) A.I., (Ooh) A.I.<br>
        (Ooh) A.I., (Ooh) A.I., (Ooh) A.I., (Ooh) A.I.<br>
        
        [Outro]<br>
        I only ever really<br>
        I only ever really<br>
        To wash away all the blood<br>
